	<h1> Me <i class="w3-opacity w3-text-xsmall">and photos</i></h1>
	<p>I'm Peter I just like to take photos, I'm not a photographer.</p>
	<p>If theres any indictaion of that it's that I use a samsung J5 2017 to take them.</p>
	<p>The first photo I made that made me proud was a margate sunset, it was mainly the quality of it because I find it hard to keep my hands still when using a phone but the more I looked at it the happier I became. I looked at the way the sun hit the ripples of the waves and the very small boat on these lumescent waves. I thought it was good.</p>
	<p>From that time on I found out I enjoyed taking photos, it felt like I was getting something done (whether well or not is subjective but I think I am getting better)</p>
	<p>One image that I'm proud of although it is pixelated and slanty is the one of the two birds coliding. Although there are a lot of things wrong with that image like over-all quality and the slantiness of it, I enjoyed looking at that picture. Capturing that moment felt great eventhough it was complete luck.</p>
	<p>I decided to make a website because I'm bored and want a place to put my photos where I could format them freely. So after stealing a template and a styleseet from w3 schools here it is.</p>
	<p>I don't want to come off the wrong way I'm not secretly egocentrical and want to pretend I'm just a guy, I just read through it and it reads like something that came straight out of Yoko-ono's biography, I just like taking photos.</p>
