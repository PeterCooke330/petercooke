	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm Peter Cooke</p>
	<p>I'm a cinephile who likes to act and take photos. Recently, due to COVID-19, I have been unable to attend school, however I have sent my time watching Life on Mars and studying for my cisco entry exam. Although this may seem like pandering outside of work I enjoy programming and solving problems, currently I am using <a href="http://www.edabit.com/">Edabit</a> to make sure it stays in my head and to challenge myself to do better.</p>
	<p>I am also a member of <a href="http://actorsworkshop.org.uk/">The Actors Workshop</a> a youth theatre company which I have been attending for over 5 years putting on over 4 performances a year. This is a large part of my life which I am enjoying to go to and would like to continue to attend in the future.</p>
	<p>I started being interested in photography in 2016 in margate when I took a photo of the sunset. It was the way the light hit the water in the photo I found it quite beautiful. I hope over these 4 years I have improved, I personally think I have but that first image always has held a soft spot in my heart even though it seems quite amature compared to some of the photos I have taken since. When I was sponsered to review Saal Digitals proffesion line photobook I chose that image the cover. I used to take photos with a Samsung J5 but now I use a Canon 1200D for most of the heavy work and a Google Pixel 3A for when I don't have my camera.</p>
	<p>To relax I like to watch films and play games. Like most social recluses I am a massive Dr Who fan and a 'Trekkie'. I mean while typing this I am sat surrounded by Dr who minifigures,  Daleks, The extended novella of docotr who and a little figure of the NCC-1701. In the way of reading ignoring the aforementioned Dr who books, I enjoy classic horror like the works of H.P.Lovecraft and the classic science fiction like Issac Asimov, Frank Herbet and Phillip K. Dick.</p>
